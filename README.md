# Trade or Sale

This is my failed attempt into building an e-commerce site.

The idea is to build a a webapp so users doesn't have to create facebook profile as stores but instead use the webapp to manage their items and sell them through a facebook app which will serve as the frontend.

The site is very much incomplete since I ran out of resources and can no longer afford to work on it. This is the whole source code of the site as shown in the video, I thought somebody might find it useful. :)
